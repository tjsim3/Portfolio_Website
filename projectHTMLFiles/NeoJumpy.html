        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>NeoJumpy is a simple re-design of the popular arcade game Doodle Jump. The game was created as a final project for my Junior year Unity class, where we were to make a video game for a specific age group, mine being 8-12 year olds. The objective of the game is to get as many points as possible by moving the player as jumps from platform to platform, avoiding rockets and trying not to fall.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Endless Gameplay: The game runs forever, with increasing speed as the player progresses.</li>
        <li>Obstacles: Players must jump from platform to platform without falling, but as their score increases, different blocks will appear, and eventually rockets will shoot at them that they must dodge.</li>
        <li>Score System: Points are awarded based on height achieved, encouraging players to play for a new high score.</li>
        <li>Simple Controls: The game is designed for easy playability with simple controls: the left and right arrow keys.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <p>The game was developed using Unity, and coded in C#.</p>

        <h2>How I incorporated AI into this project</h2>
        <p>I originally used ChatGPT to give me sources that I could read on what kids in my target age group were looking for. As a result I found that they want simple, repetetive games that are easy to learn. I eventually landed on the idea of recreating Doodle Jump with my own twists. As I was creating the project, there were certain aspects of the game that I did not know how to code, since the class was only 1 semester long, so I used AI to teach me syntax for new commands that I had not learned.</p>
        
        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>Time. This project was to be completed in 2 weeks, and was in the middle of AP testing weeks, so I had missed multiple days of work time. As a result, some visual cleanliness was lost, but the game still runs as planned.</p>
        
        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <p>The main idea for future updates is to improve the animations and make it more visually pleasing. That is what was lost in the lack of time, so given more time I would add that into the game and make it a lot more fun.</p>

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>This project may not have had much impact on the world, but it taught me how to use AI to learn new code functions, and how to decide what is most important when I am in a time crunch</p>
