        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p></p>
        
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Solves kinematic equations using Python on a computer, or a calculator</li>
        <li>Has larger and smaller versions to fit space needed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <p>The code was developed using Python on VScode </p>

        <h2>How I incorporated AI into this project</h2>
        <p>In the first iteration (run on the computer) I wanted to have the most possible options to solve for variables, so I used chatGPT to write a list with the all possible equations derived to solve for specific variables when given others. This would have taken an hour or two of my time, and AI was able to complete it in a few seconds. I also used AI to explain to me what I was doing wrong when I had errors, as when I was making this project I was still learning Python.</p>
        
        <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
        <p>The only challenge I faced on this challenge was my lack of Python knowledge. After making this project, I begun watching the MIT coursework YouTube videos, and begun lessons on Codedex.io.</p>
        
        <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
        <p>In the future, I may improve this to be more easy to read, as right now it is fairly hard to comprehend since the text is so small on the calculator.</p>

        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>This program made it easier for me and friends to solve kinematic equations quickly when doing homework</p>
